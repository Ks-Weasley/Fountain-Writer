(\/\*)
	Accept anything that is not a star : (^\*)*
	Accept stars that are not followed by /: \*((^\/)|[\r\n])*
	Accept */ provided there is a */ later without a /*: ((^(\/\*))(\*\/))*
	
	Try the negative part; If I dont see a /*, i should not see a */: (^(\/\*))(.|[\r\n])*(^(\*\/))
	If I see a /*, I must definitely see a */: (\/\*)(.|[\r\n])*(\*\/)
(\*\/)

\/\*([^\*]|[\r\n]|(\*+([^\*\/]|[\r\n])))*\*+\/


Try using combination of regexes instead. Seems to be much faster
